Observations:

1. 'addmats.cpp'
The assembly code for addmats.cpp is longer and more complex due to the use of classes and object-oriented programming.
The constructor and class method calls introduce additional instructions, particularly related to object creation and memory management.
More memory is utilized on the stack to manage object data members.
Variables are passed using registers, and thereâ€™s more setup code for managing objects and functions.
While the matrix addition loop is present, it is surrounded by extra code related to the object-oriented structure.

2. 'addmatsSimple.c'
The assembly for addmatsSimple.c is shorter and more straightforward than the C++ version.
Since this version does not use any classes or objects, the compiler generates fewer instructions.
The loop to add matrix elements is directly visible in the assembly code.
The function logic is directly in main(), with no extra complexity from function calls or object handling.

3. 'addmatsSubr.c'
In addmatsSubr.c, the matrix addition is performed in a separate function, which results in an extra function call in the assembly code.
This extra function call makes the assembly code slightly longer than addmatsSimple.c, but still shorter than the C++ version.
The function itself operates similarly to the loop in addmatsSimple.c, adding values from two arrays and storing the result.
The assembly shows the function call and return, but does not involve any object management, keeping it simpler than the C++ version.
4. 'basic.c'
Here C code turns into a bunch of detailed steps in assembly, code like a = a, becomes a precise command for the computer. The assembly lasnguage carries out each instructions one step at a time.
